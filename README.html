<h1>HybRIDS</h1>

<p><strong>An R package for simple visualisation of recombinant regions and mosaic genome structures. Including block detection and simple dating estimation.</strong></p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>HybRIDS is an R package that began life as some code to allow colleagues to attractively visualize the mosaic structure of
a sequence - what was wanted turned out to be more complex than usual plotting in R the casual user may usually do and required use of several libraries and a non-trivial amount of data-munging and code.</p>

<p>Therefore we decided to provide this package for other researchers so they can quickly visualize the mosaic structure of sequences in a visually appealing way - thanks to R&#39;s wonderful graphical system - 
along with the ability to detect potential blocks based on the analysis method, and also to date those putative blocks. We then also coded a graphical user interface for the package to assist the occasional R user.<br/>
HybRIDS then can cater to the individual who is comfortable with code and who wants to script many analyses steps together and want&#39;s to include some HybRIDS visualisation and dating, and also to the user who wants to quickly get output 
without having to do any scripting.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>R Packages are typically distributed as either a source or binary distribution. Instructions for both are given below.</p>

<p>First it is essential to have a working up to date install of R on your computer. HybRIDS has been developed largely
under R version 2 but was finalised under R version 3 and used with R version 3 without issue.</p>

<p>You can get a stable working binary file from the ELSA website:</p>

<h2>On Windows</h2>

<h3>From binary distribution</h3>

<ol>
<li>On Windows open the R GUI (The R icon in your programs desktop). (It should not matter if it is 32 or 64 bit).</li>
<li>Go to Packages &amp; Data menu.</li>
<li>If you downloaded the file from the ELSA website change the dropdown menu that says &ldquo;Cran Binaries&rdquo; so as it selects &ldquo;Local Binary Package&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Click the install button and then in the window that appears, select the binary file - wherever that may be on your computer. Then click the open button.</li>
</ol>

<h3>From source distribution</h3>

<ol>
<li>On Windows open the R GUI (The R icon in your programs desktop). (It should not matter if it is 32 or 64 bit).</li>
<li>Go to Packages &amp; Data menu.</li>
<li>If you downloaded the file from the ELSA website change the dropdown menu that says &ldquo;Cran Binaries&rdquo; so as it selects &ldquo;Local source Package&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Click the install button and then in the window that appears, select the binary file - wherever that may be on your computer. Then click the open button.</li>
</ol>

<h2>On a Mac</h2>

<h3>From binary distribution</h3>

<ol>
<li>On mac open the R GUI (The R icon in your Mac applications).</li>
<li>Go to Packages &amp; Data menu.</li>
<li>If you downloaded the file from the ELSA website change the dropdown menu that says &ldquo;Cran Binaries&rdquo; so as it selects &ldquo;Local Binary Package&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Click the install button and then in the window that appears, select the binary file - wherever that may be on your computer. Then click the open button.</li>
</ol>

<h3>From source distribution</h3>

<li>Go to Packages &amp; Data menu.</li>

<li>Click the install button and then in the window that appears, select the binary file - wherever that may be on your computer. Then click the open button.</li>
</ol>

<h2>On Linux based systems</h2>

<h3>From a binary distribution</h3>

<ol>
<li>Open R in a linux terminal and use the following command:</li>
</ol>

<p><code>install.packages(file_name_and_path, repos = NULL, type=&quot;source&quot;)</code></p>

<p>Replace &ldquo;file_name_and_path&rdquo; with the name and location of the file.</p>

<h3>From binary distribution</h3>

<ol>
<li>Open R in a linux terminal and use the following command:</li>
</ol>

<p><code>install.packages(file_name_and_path, repos = NULL)</code></p>

<p>Replace &ldquo;file_name_and_path&rdquo; with the name and location of the file.</p>

<h1>Running HybRIDS</h1>

<p>Running HybRIDS is simple: On your machine you first need to start R. Do this by either typing R on the linux command line to start R in the terminal 
(some nicer distros like Ubuntu may have an easy to use icon/shortcut, but don&#39;t rely on that!), or if you&#39;re on Mac or Windows you will find you start 
R just like you would any other windows program or macbook app.</p>

<p>Once R is open, and you have installed HybRIDS as described above you simply need to invoke the library command:</p>

<p><code>library(HybRIDS)</code></p>

<p>You will be asked if you want to use the graphical user interface (GUI) for HybRIDS. If you do not need it and instead want to use HybRIDS&#39;s exported 
functions, then you can click no.
Note that saying yes to the GUI does not mean you cannot use the exported functions for use in the R console.</p>

<h2>The exported functions</h2>

<p>HybRIDS comes with the following exported functions. The documentation of each can be viewed from within R by typing:
<code>?function_name_here</code> in the R console.</p>
