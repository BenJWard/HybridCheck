Starting HybRIDS and Loading Data
------------------------------------
 
To get started fire up the R condole and enter:
 
```R
library(HybRIDS)
```
 
You should see the following printed to the console:
 
The package is now successfully loaded.

Loading in sequence data and starting a new HybRIDS analysis
------------------------------------------------------------
 
To get started using HybRIDS to analyse a set of sequences, you first have to create a new HybRIDS object. Do this either with the R console or the Graphical Interface.
 
**With the R console:**
 
The HybRIDS object will contain all data, options, and will carry out the analysis. So everything you do in HybRIDS is done by interacting with this object.
By providing a file-path to a FASTA format sequence file when the new object is created the DNA data will also be loaded and prepared automatically.
 
```R
> MyAnalysis <- HybRIDS$new("~/Desktop/MySequence.fasta")
```
With the above line I have created a new HybRIDS object and assigned it to a variable "MyAnalysis" - that is to say I made a new HybRIDS object that is called "MyAnalysis" and now it is in the R workspace ready for us to use by calling it's methods.
 
HybRIDS prints several progress messages and let's you know when the object has been successfully created:
 
```R
Detected file is supposed to be a FASTA format file...
Reading in DNA sequence file...
Looking for duplicates...
Done...
Subsetting the informative segregating sites...
Done, now saving data internally
 :Full Sequence
 :Informative bases only
Finished DNA input.
```
 
The HybRIDS package has been loaded, and data has been read in and is now contained in a HybRIDS object, which also contains all analysis settings and steps.
