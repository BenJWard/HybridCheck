# KnownDatedSummary.csv

This dataframe is an output where ach row is a known recombinant
block made by HybRIDS.

This dataframe contains the following important columns:

It is a summarized format of the data presented in DetectionDatedAll.csv

**ActualAgeBefore:**
The actual amount of time (in mu * generations) that the parental sequences
in the triplet diverged before coming together to form the recombinant sequence.

**ActualAge:**
The actual amount of time (in mu * generations) since the recombination
event that generated the block occured.

**mean05:**
The mean 5% age estimate for the blocks found in triplets.

**sd05:**
The standard deviation of the 5% age estimate for the blocks found in triplets.

**mean50:**
The mean 50% age estimate for the blocks found in triplets.

**sd50:**
The standard deviation of the 50% age estimate for the blocks found in triplets.

**mean95:**
The mean 95% age estimate for the blocks found in triplets.

**sd95:**
The standard deviation of the 95% age estimate for the blocks found in triplets.
