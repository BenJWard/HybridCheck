# detectionPercentagesSummary

This file contains the following columns:

**DivBefore:**
The actual amount of time (in mu * generations) that the parental sequences
in the triplet diverged before coming together to form the recombinant sequence.

**DivAfter:**
The actual amount of time (in mu * generations) since the recombination
event that generated the block occured.

**mean:**
The mean percentage of the known recombination blocks in triplets correctly detected by HybRIDS.

**lower:**
The 0.5CI percentage of the known recombination blocks in triplets correctly detected by HybRIDS.

**upper:**
The 0.95CI percentage of the known recombination blocks in triplets correctly detected by HybRIDS.
