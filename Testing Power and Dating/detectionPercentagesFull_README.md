This file contains the following columns:

**percentageDetected:**
The percentage of the known recombination regions in triplets correctly detected by HybRIDS.

**DivBefore:**
The actual amount of time (in mu * generations) that the parental sequences
in the triplet diverged before coming together to form the recombinant sequence.

**DivAfter:**
The actual amount of time (in mu * generations) since the recombination
event that generated the block occured.
