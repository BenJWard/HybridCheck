What is HybridCheck? 
----------------

---
 
HybridCheck is an R package that began life as some code to allow us to attractively visualize the mosaic structure of a sequences, for publication.<br>
What was wanted turned out to be more complex than usual plotting in R the casual user may usually do and required use of several libraries and a non-trivial amount of data-munging and code.
Therefore we decided to provide this package for other researchers so they can quickly visualize the mosaic structure of sequences in a visually appealing way - thanks to R's wonderful graphical system.

Besides plotting, we also wanted to scanning DNA sequences and applying simple criteria highlight potential recombinant regions, and then date those regions with a simplified approximate dating method. This is what HybridCheck does, scanning, detection, dating and plotting according to simple criteria and statistics. The package was intended to help our group scan large contigs and genomic regions, highlight regions for more complex and computationally intensive analysis, and so save time and direct research effort. We then also coded a graphical user interface for the package to assist the occasional R user.

HybridCheck then can cater to the individual who is comfortable with code and who wants to script many analyses steps together (sometimes with other great R packages for analysis of molecular sequences and evolution like ape, Bioconductor etc.) and want's to include some HybridCheck visualisation and dating. It also caters to the user who wants to quickly get output without having to do any scripting.

The project is in it's final launch stages and we are just making sure everything's working well and it performs well on simulated data and popular published real datasets other than those it was developed and tested with. The Github Repository has the latest release considered stable (main branch) and also an unstable branch (devel).

To begin using HybridCheck start by looking for the installation instructions on this website, the Wiki at the repository or the README in the source archive. If anybody has issues if you use the GitHub issue tracking system or email (See contact page) we will do our best to help out.

We developed HybridCheck in parallel with our own research on evolution and population genetics at ELSA and the NBI, and will continue to develop this project as we come up with new functionality that we would find helpful in our research. We hope if it is useful to us then it will be used and liked by others working on similar research and projects.
