## The HybRIDS manual

The HybRIDS user manual instructs the user how to install R and then HybRIDS to their machine, and how to then conduct their analysis using the HybRIDS web app to analyse their data. It assumes no coding or R knowlege as the launchers are used to install or update the nessecery dependencies as well as launch the app, with which the user can use the functionality of the HybRIDS package without needing any R experience.

The manual is divided up according to the tasks you would perform with HybRIDS, from loading the package and reading in data, to altering the options for and running the analysis, and exporting data and plotting data.

Users experienced with R will be able to just install the HybRIDS R package from the github repository using devtools, and will find inforation in the 'Programming with HybRIDS vignette' and R help system manpages for the package.
