## The HybridCheck manual

The HybridCheck user manual instructs the user how to install R and then HybridCheck to their machine, and how to then conduct their analysis using the HybridCheck web app to analyse their data. It assumes no coding or R knowlege as the launchers are used to install or update the nessecery dependencies as well as launch the app, with which the user can use the functionality of the HybridCheck package without needing any R experience.

The manual is divided up according to the tasks you would perform with HybridCheck, from loading the package and reading in data, to altering the options for and running the analysis, and exporting data and plotting data.

Users experienced with R will be able to just install the HybridCheck R package from the github repository using devtools, and will find information in the vignette below.
