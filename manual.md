This manual is written with the intention of being your first stop for finding out how to use HybRIDS to do an
analysis of some of your sequences. Before you go any further, you should head over to our getting started page for advice 
on installing R and so HybRIDS. That information is given in a separate section and page, rather than the manual, because installing and 
getting to grips with R in detail, would be a huge and arguably unrelated segment to the manual on it's own.

The manual is divided up according to the tasks you would perform with HybRIDS, from loading the package and reading in data, to altering the options for and running the analysis, and exporting data and plotting data.
